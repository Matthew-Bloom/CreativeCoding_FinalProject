- Objects are iterating unevenly.
  - Whatever object runs interact() last has no issues, but the objects that iterate before that have the future objects iterated on top of it.
  - This gets worse the earlier the object is iterated.
  
- Computer is as of yet uncoded. 
  - This is to come only after everything else.

- Things are too static. Add more changing variables and creepy things.
  - Things don't happen often enough.
  
- The stage is too dull. Make it more interesting.
  - Some kind of carpet? Edit the "mockup" file.
  
  
  
*********Not just change, but CHANGE OVER TIME.*********
